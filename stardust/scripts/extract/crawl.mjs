/**
 * crawl.mjs — reference Playwright crawler for stardust:extract.
 *
 * Solves two stardust multitest findings:
 *   #4  extract ships no runnable crawler — every migration re-implements the
 *       Playwright recipe by hand (expensive, inconsistent). This is the bundled
 *       `extract/scripts/crawl.mjs` the recipe always implied.
 *   #7  capture hardening — the hand-rolled crawls captured hidden / transient /
 *       modal DOM as real content (consent banners and "temporarily unavailable"
 *       overlays became headings; AJAX-modal detail pages captured byte-identical
 *       to their listing; SPA shells captured a tracking pixel + global h1 as a
 *       "page"). This crawler filters those at capture time.
 *
 * It implements the CORE of reference/playwright-recipe.md (browser config +
 * bot-management fallback, consent dismissal, wait+scroll, the capture list,
 * response validation) plus the finding-#7 hardening below. The recipe remains
 * the authoritative field spec; extend the in-page capture() to match it fully.
 *
 * Hardening (#7), all applied inside the page context:
 *   - VISIBILITY FILTER: headings/body/CTAs skip nodes that are display:none,
 *     visibility:hidden, aria-hidden, [hidden], or off-screen / zero-area.
 *   - INTERSTITIAL/ERROR heuristic: nodes matching known consent / language-gate
 *     / "temporarily unavailable" patterns are dropped from content and counted
 *     in `_filtered`.
 *   - MODAL/AJAX capture: [role=dialog] / .modal / [aria-modal] containers are
 *     read via textContent even when display:none (XHR-populated detail), so a
 *     URL-addressable modal route is not captured as its listing page.
 *   - TRACKING-PIXEL = zero media: a lone off-origin <=2px img doesn't count as
 *     "has media" (so the low-media flag fires on an SPA shell).
 *   - SUBSTANCE check: a page with <2 distinct in-main headings AND tiny main
 *     innerText AND no real media is flagged `spaShellSuspect`.
 *   - DUPLICATE check (cross-page, after the crawl): a page whose main-content
 *     hash equals another page's is flagged `duplicateOf` (catches detail==listing).
 *     Attribution is deterministic by discovery order: the earliest-queued page
 *     per hash is canonical, regardless of pool completion order.
 *   - RENDERED DOM: the settled page's `page.content()` is saved verbatim as
 *     <out>/pages/<slug>.html next to the JSON (path in the record's
 *     `renderedHtml` field). Capture once, parse offline: importers and sibling
 *     generators iterate their extraction against this artifact (free,
 *     reproducible, and provenance) instead of re-running live probes per
 *     selector guess. Live probes stay for what the static DOM cannot answer
 *     (geometry, computed styles).
 *   - SCREENSHOT: a full-page PNG per page under <out>/assets/screenshots/<slug>.png.
 *     Chromium silently WRAPS a full-page raster above its 16,384 px texture
 *     limit (rows repeat, the tail is lost, nothing throws), so a page taller
 *     than SHOT_WRAP_PX is captured in clip BANDS (<slug>.png, <slug>.part2.png…;
 *     _signals.screenshotMode 'banded', screenshotBands, docHeight); a raster
 *     that throws falls back to the first viewport ('clipped' — the tail is
 *     missing by instrument, never a vision-gate `suspect`). Mode in
 *     _signals.screenshotMode, relative path in the record's `screenshot` field.
 *   - 360 SHOT (--mobile entry|all|none, default entry): the same page, no
 *     navigation (consent + solved bot state inherited), re-laid out at
 *     360×900 → <slug>-360.png (`screenshotMobile`, _signals.screenshotMobileMode).
 *     Replica's 360 pass starts from it instead of guessing the mobile layout.
 *   - CAPTURE QUALITY: _signals.emptyMain (a <main> exists but is blank with
 *     no real image — client-rendered page captured before hydration),
 *     brokenImages / subResourceBlock (images 403'd by the edge while the
 *     document loaded), overlayCoverPct (fixed-position overlay ∩ first
 *     viewport — a survey/feedback modal the consent pass did not know).
 *     captureQuality 'degraded' is recorded, never thrown: the DOM is still
 *     evidence; Phase 2.5 treats it as `suspect` until recaptured.
 *   - COMPAT MODE: _provenance.compatMode ('CSS1Compat' | 'BackCompat') — a
 *     legacy site rendering in quirks mode needs its doctype mirrored, or the
 *     replica lays out standards-mode boxes against quirks-mode ground truth.
 *
 * Schema 2 (current-state-schema.md; _provenance.schemaVersion = SCHEMA_VERSION):
 *   capture() emits the documented per-page shape from ONE settled render —
 *   headings with style/domPath + inferred display heads, heroHeadline/heroLede,
 *   landmarks[].children[] (body/lists/qa/quotes/richtext, live rect),
 *   ctas[].style, links{internal,external}, media.images[] objects with
 *   `resolves` read from the rendered state (never a second request),
 *   cssBackgrounds[] objects incl. ::before/::after, inlineSvgs, iframes →
 *   embedDominance, forms[] (schema shape, always), widgets, components,
 *   perSectionStyle[], stats (+ motifs counts), themeColor, language,
 *   cssCustomProperties[], _signals.shadowRoots/inferredHeadings/iconFont.
 *   Open shadow roots are descended (deepAll) and serialised into the sidecar
 *   (serializeDom → declarative <template shadowrootmode>). 0.24.x aliases
 *   written beside the schema names: description, media.imgs, customProps,
 *   headings[].tag. SCHEMA GATE: every written record passes validateRecord;
 *   a FAIL stays on disk, is logged as errorClass SchemaError and is never a
 *   success (validate-page.mjs re-runs the check offline; Phase 6 marks only
 *   passing records `extracted`).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node crawl.mjs --url https://example.com [--pages /a,/b] [--cap 25 | --all | --single] \
 *     [--refresh slug,slug | --force] [--out stardust/current] [--wait medium] \
 *     [--no-consent-dismiss] [--concurrency 4] [--dynamics] [--headed[=window]] \
 *     [--mobile entry|all|none] [--dpr 1] [--depth 1] [--cookie name=value[;Path=/]]... \
 *     [--storage-state <file> | --fresh-state] [--save-state] [--solve-wait <ms>] \
 *     [--progress <file> | --no-progress] [--assets intercept|full|none | --no-assets] \
 *     [--assets-max <n>] [--assets-max-bytes <n>] [--prep]
 *   node crawl.mjs --help
 *
 * --prep: the migrate-prep run (extract/reference/prep-mode.md § 1) — implies --all unless
 *   --cap / --single / --pages is given, and is recorded as runs[].args.prep so
 *   brand-surface.mjs never auto-bounds a prep run that also carried --pages.
 *
 * Asset harvest (default on; --no-assets disables; --assets full adds capped in-page
 *   fetches): the render's own image/font bodies are kept from the response stream —
 *   zero extra requests — under assets/media/ and assets/fonts/ as
 *   <basename>-<sha1:8>.<ext> (ext = sniffed mime; a mismatch with the URL is
 *   transformSuspect, never "fixed"); images[]/cssBackgrounds[] get localPath |
 *   downloadError; assets/_media-manifest.json and assets/_fonts-manifest.json
 *   (@font-face descriptors, licensingFlag, iconFonts[]) merge by URL across runs;
 *   the favicon SET (every link[rel~=icon]/apple-touch-icon/mask-icon + /favicon.ico)
 *   → assets/icons/ + assets/favicon-set.json — the ONE exception to "zero extra
 *   requests": ≤ 8 icon URLs fetched once per run on the probe page (the probe's own
 *   favicon is reused, not re-fetched); --no-assets skips it. runs[].assets sums the run.
 *
 * Completion contract (skills/stardust/scripts/progress.mjs): while the pool runs the
 *   crawler writes <out>/../.work/extract/crawl.progress.json (default; --progress
 *   overrides, --no-progress disables) — done/ok/failed per page, atomic — and its LAST
 *   stdout line is `SUMMARY crawl ok=<n> failed=<n> exit=<code> details=<_crawl-log.json> …`.
 *   Run it in the background and read the progress file (`progress.mjs read <file>`),
 *   never `sleep N; grep -c` the log. Exit codes unchanged: 0 (per-page failures are in
 *   the log), 1 live lock held, 2 fatal, 3 bot challenge (§ Exit codes below). A project copy loads the helper from
 *   stardust/scripts/stardust/progress.mjs (copy it beside class-report.mjs); without it
 *   the SUMMARY line still prints and one WARN names the copy.
 *
 * Interactive solve (--solve-wait <ms>): PerimeterX "Press & Hold", Cloudflare
 *   Turnstile and hCaptcha never clear without a human. The flag starts at
 *   tier 3 with the window VISIBLE, skips the wait+reload loop on the probe
 *   (a reload destroys a Press & Hold in progress), polls the same page every
 *   2.5 s and resumes after two consecutive clean polls (no challenge DOM or
 *   phrase, ≥ 800 chars of text, taller than 1.5 viewports), then saves the
 *   storage state for the downstream instruments; unsolved at the deadline →
 *   BotChallengeError (exit 3). Probe only — workers inherit the solved state.
 *   Challenge markers (challengeMarker, mirrored in live-session.mjs): the
 *   Cloudflare/Akamai/F5/Imperva 403|429|503 signatures, HTTP 400 + AkamaiGHost
 *   (Akamai's escalation body), and on any 4xx/5xx a _pxhd|_px3|_pxvid|datadome
 *   set-cookie or DataDome header (a PerimeterX 403 via Varnish carries no other
 *   signature). A 200 is never a challenge here — PX/DataDome set their ids on
 *   admitted pages too; the DOM stage (--solve-wait) covers the 200-status walls.
 *
 * Admitted session (mirror of diff/scripts/live-session.mjs resolveStorageState —
 *   this file ships alone): the probe context's storageState (clearance,
 *   consent, A/B cookies) is CLONED into every worker context, so a probe that
 *   cleared a challenge no longer hands the workers a fresh, re-challenged
 *   context. <out>/_storage-state.json (= stardust/current/_storage-state.json,
 *   never tracked) is loaded into the probe when one of its cookie domains
 *   matches the host (--storage-state <file> names another, --fresh-state opts
 *   out) and written when a challenge was cleared or --save-state is given.
 *   Limits: fingerprint-bound clearances (PerimeterX/HUMAN) and Cloudflare's
 *   per-session escalation do not replay — a re-challenged state still fails
 *   loud. _provenance.storageState / discovery.storageState record the reuse.
 *
 * Discovery (ia-extraction.md § Discovery order — discoverInventory below):
 *   --pages > robots.txt `Sitemap:` directives (all of them) > /sitemap.xml,
 *   /sitemap_index.xml > /.sitemap.xml, /sitemap.aspx (only when the tiers
 *   above are empty and the origin is not bot-walled) > the probe page's nav
 *   links (always unioned) > BFS --depth N (≤ 3, in-page fetch hops, breadth
 *   max(200, cap); depth 1 under a bot block). A non-root --url path scopes
 *   the roster to that subtree (taken from the URL as TYPED, before any
 *   redirect); the census of everything declared is logged regardless.
 *   --cookie seeds every context (age gates, region pins); names only are logged.
 *
 * --dpr <n> sets deviceScaleFactor (default 1, recorded in _provenance.dpr): the
 *   gate captures at DPR 1, and a DPR-2 ground truth would never pixel-match it
 *   (decision D4 — keep 1, record it).
 *
 * Scope: ia-extraction.md § Incremental re-runs is the rule (--pages exact
 *   paths, --refresh / --force vs the default skip of slugs already extracted
 *   in ../state.json — read-only here; a missing file means no skip).
 * Log (ia-extraction.md § _crawl-log.json shape): one runs[] entry per
 *   invocation; crawl.failures is the union across runs minus slugs that later
 *   succeeded; discovery never shrinks on a narrower re-run.
 *
 * Bot-management ladder (playwright-recipe.md § Bot-management fallback):
 *   tier 1 headless → tier 2 chrome-headless → tier 3 chrome-headed-offscreen.
 *   A challenge at tiers 1–2 escalates after ONE hit — at the probe AND at
 *   capture time (a worker context re-challenged after the probe cleared
 *   drains the pool, relaunches one tier up and requeues the unfinished
 *   pages); only tier 3 runs the wait+reload solve window. --headed starts at
 *   tier 2, --headed=window at tier 3; a re-run starts at the tier recorded in
 *   _crawl-log.json#discovery.fetchTechnique, which is the tier that actually
 *   captured. The tier-3 window is parked off-screen unless STARDUST_HEADED_WINDOW=1.
 * Live budget per host (HostBudget — the crawl-local copy of the planned
 *   diff/scripts/live-budget.mjs; this file ships alone): every navigation
 *   waits for a token (≤ 10/min) AND a minimum gap (≥ 3 s; robots.txt
 *   Crawl-delay widens it — decisions.md `crawl` row; a stricter ceiling
 *   learned earlier is read from stardust/live-budget.json and expires
 *   LIVE_BUDGET_TTL_MS = 7 days after `learnedAt`). The pool drops to
 *   ONE worker under a bot block (tier > 1 or a cleared challenge — concurrency
 *   4 drew 9 re-challenges even with the cloned session) and after the first
 *   BARE 429 (no edge signature = rate limit, not a challenge): the ceiling is
 *   halved and persisted (merge-by-host), Retry-After honoured (≤ 60 s), the
 *   page retried ONCE, then recorded as HTTPError { rateLimited: true } with
 *   the hint. The PROBE takes the same path (a 429 on the first hit is not
 *   "admitted"): retried once after the wait, then fatal HTTPError (exit 2)
 *   with the halved ceiling persisted before exit. The budget exists from the
 *   first navigation: discovery's sitemap children and BFS hops are paced too
 *   (the ≤ 5 guessed probes are not), and the gap widens once Crawl-delay is
 *   read. stardust/.work/live-<host>.lock (pid liveness; STARDUST_LIVE_FORCE=1
 *   overrides) keeps two live tools off one origin at once — the recorded
 *   "two launches within a minute, both challenged" class; the lock is
 *   re-keyed to the post-redirect host (apex→www) so it matches the budget's.
 * Exit codes (exitCodeOf): 0 done (per-page failures are in the log) ·
 *   1 LiveLockError (another live tool holds stardust/.work/live-<host>.lock —
 *   wait for it, or STARDUST_LIVE_FORCE=1) · 2 fatal · 3 BotChallengeError
 *   (tier 3 still challenged, or --solve-wait expired — never captured as content).
 * Exports (for evals/fixtures/*.test.mjs and the sibling extract scripts, which
 *   import ./crawl.mjs — copy the set together): slugify, assignSlugs, MOBILE_SHOT_SUFFIX,
 *   exitCodeOf, noteRateLimited, probeRateLimited, needsStateSave, mergeCrawlLog, runArgsRecord,
 *   RUN_LEVEL_DISCOVERY, TIERS, tierOf, captureQualityOf, SHOT_WRAP_PX,
 *   OVERLAY_FLAG_PCT, discoverInventory, parseRobots, parseCookieFlag,
 *   challengeMarker, CHALLENGE_PHRASE, HostBudget, BUDGET_DEFAULT,
 *   parseRetryAfter, mergeLiveBudget, tuneBudget, LIVE_BUDGET_TTL_MS, sessionReusedOf,
 *   UNPACED_DISCOVERY, capture, serializeDom, SCHEMA_VERSION, REQUIRED_KEYS,
 *   validateRecord, validateProvenance, WAIT_MODE_RE, CONSENT_LABELS, stripCdnParams,
 *   sniffMime, assetPath, mergeManifest, licensingFlagFor, fullAssetCandidates,
 *   buildFontsManifest, FONT_URL_RE —
 *   importing this module runs nothing; main() runs only when the file is
 *   the entry script.
 *
 * Needs playwright importable from the project (see extract/SKILL.md Setup —
 * `npm i -D playwright` or the Playwright MCP server; the `npx playwright`
 * availability probe alone does NOT make the ESM module importable).
