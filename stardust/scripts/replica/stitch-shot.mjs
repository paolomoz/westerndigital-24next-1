 * skills/replica/scripts/stitch-shot.mjs
 *
 * Scroll-and-stitch full-page screenshot for the stardust:replica
 * source-fidelity gate. Chromium's fullPage:true (captureBeyondViewport)
 * renders lazy-decoded images as gray placeholders on JS-heavy live sites —
 * a fullPage shot of a page whose DOM says "loaded" can still be visually
 * wrong. This tool scrolls viewport by viewport, waits for in-viewport image
 * completeness per chunk, screenshots each chunk, and stitches the PNG.
 *
 * Run it IDENTICALLY on the live page and on the served prototype so the
 * instrument is symmetric — an asymmetric capture (fullPage on one side,
 * stitch on the other) manufactures pixel diffs that aren't there.
 *
 * Hardening baked in (each one is a recorded false-measurement trap; the
 * live-navigation pieces live in the shared ../../diff/scripts/live-session.mjs):
 *   - real-Chrome UA + the STANDARD REQUEST HEADERS by default: the default
 *     HeadlessChrome UA gets a Cloudflare managed challenge on many live
 *     sites, and UA alone still 403s on Akamai (F-R1) — the standard headers
 *     (Accept / Accept-Language / sec-ch-ua*) are the other half of the fix.
 *   - a bot-management challenge/blocked interstitial FAILS LOUD (exit 3),
 *     never captured as if it were the source (the Access-Denied trap). The
 *     capture climbs the ladder itself (live-session launchLadder: headless →
 *     real Chrome headless → off-screen window; --headed starts at tier 2).
 *   - waitUntil 'domcontentloaded' (never 'networkidle'): live sites with
 *     analytics beacons never reach networkidle — hard timeout otherwise.
 *   - TWO overlay classes dismissed: cookie consent (CLICKED accept, not DOM
 *     removal, so consent-gated layout settles the way a real visit does)
 *     AND timed marketing/newsletter interstitials (CH-1: an undismissed
 *     "Sign up!" modal bakes a pixel-diff contributor into the live capture
 *     that no prototype fidelity can null out). The mouse is PARKED
 *     afterwards (bottom-left): a dismissal click leaves the cursor over the
 *     page, and any :hover-styled element under it would be silently
 *     captured in hover state.
 *   - --locale pins Accept-Language + context locale: geo-redirecting sites
 *     (recorded: a car brand → /ch-de/, a fashion brand → /ww/) otherwise capture
 *     a different locale per run — nondeterministic live side.
 *   - animation/transition freeze is injected AFTER the lazyload settle
 *     pass: injecting it before breaks some lazy loaders' swap logic. The
 *     freeze also pauses every <video> at t=0 and clears all pending JS
 *     timeouts/intervals (CSS-only freezing stops neither <video> playback
 *     nor slick-style autoplay timers — the same page never pixel-matched
 *     itself), then clicks the first slick-convention carousel dot so both
 *     sides capture slide 1 deterministically. All symmetric — applied
 *     identically to live and prototype, so it cannot bias the diff.
 *   - FONT-LOAD assertion before capture (F-B2 companion): a webfont that
 *     failed to fetch renders the whole capture in fallback type — the same
 *     silent-false-measurement class as capturing a challenge page. After
 *     document.fonts.ready, any declared FontFace with status 'error' is
 *     reported LOUDLY with the family names; the operator must decide
 *     whether the failure is instrument-induced (a capture defect — fix the
 *     instrument) or real on the live site (capture-state — log it).
 *   - page height is measured AFTER the settle pass: entrance-animated
 *     sites inflate scrollHeight until elements go inview, so the
 *     pre-settle height is fake.
 *   - PROVENANCE SIDECAR: every capture writes <out>.png.json next to the
 *     PNG (schema in ./capture-sidecar.mjs): url, width, vh, dpr,
 *     capturedAt, instrument {name, version, options}, consent {mode, via},
 *     dismissed[], fontsFailed[], docHeight, chunks, source, technique.
 *     pixel-compare / crop-compare refuse a pair whose sidecars differ in
 *     instrument.name, width, vh, dpr or consent.mode — mixed-instrument and
 *     mixed-consent compares produced whole false rounds in the field.
 *   - CONSENT MODE is one instrument parameter, the same on capture and
 *     gate: --consent-mode accept (default) clicks accept; deny goes through
 *     live-session's dismissOverlays({ mode: 'deny' }), which clicks a
 *     reject-all control (--consent <sel> first, then OneTrust / Usercentrics
 *     / "Reject all") and NEVER tries the accept list. A consent dialog that
 *     is present but cannot be denied — or still up after the reject click —
 *     is an INVALID CAPTURE: exit 5, no PNG, no sidecar, no verdict (never a FAIL,
 *     never a silently accept-state reference certified as deny-state). Deny
 *     is right when accepting loads nondeterministic third-party walls the
 *     build cannot carry. The mode is recorded in the sidecar; the project's
 *     choice lives in progress.json#captureState.consent.
 *   - the extract crawl's resolved consent selector
 *     (stardust/current/_crawl-log.json#consent.method = "dismissed:<sel>" or
 *     "text:<label>") is picked up as the default --consent when present.
 *   - PINNED CHROME hidden on chunks 2+ (opacity:0 !important on every
 *     position:fixed element and every sticky element currently stuck,
 *     restored after each chunk; --keep-pinned restores the old behaviour).
 *     A fixed header re-painted once per chunk was 5–17 % of "diff" on short
 *     pages and 10–20 % across four archetypes in two field runs, and two
 *     projects patched this script locally for it. Chunk 1 keeps everything
 *     (the chrome-crop gate reads chunk-1 rows). opacity, not visibility:
 *     descendants can override visibility (EDS `header .header{visibility:
 *     visible}`), nothing undoes an ancestor's opacity, and layout is kept.
 *     A SEAM DETECTOR then compares the same viewport-relative rows of
 *     consecutive chunks and WARNs when chrome the hide missed (iframe /
 *     shadow-hosted, --keep-pinned) is still baked into ≥ 2 seams.
 *   - INTEGER SCROLL: window.scrollY is rounded before a chunk is placed —
 *     a fractional scrollY put every row of a chunk half a width off
 *     (recorded twice: "half-width rotation", 26–41 % bands). A scroll that
 *     lands > 4 px short of its target fails loud (same class as the stall
 *     guard) instead of leaving an unfilled black band.
 *   - DECODE RACE: in-viewport images are img.decode()d (1.5 s bound inside
 *     the existing 3 s window) before the chunk is shot; pendingDecodes is
 *     recorded in the sidecar.
 *   - SHORT / INVALID CAPTURE → exit 5, no PNG, no verdict: the settled
 *     height is re-measured after one more --wait (a > 25 % growth is a load
 *     race — the settle re-runs and says so); --expect-height <px> (gate.sh
 *     fills it from the crawl screenshot) makes a height under 40 % of it a
 *     retry with the wait doubled, then exit 5; an error-boundary page
 *     ("Something went wrong" in main, height < 2·vh) or a fixed / dialog
 *     element still covering > 30 % of the first viewport after dismissal
 *     (--allow-overlay to capture anyway) is exit 5 too.
 *   - TAIL LINE: rows below the footer are reported (`tail Npx below footer:
 *     <elements>`) so a residual under the footer is named, not eyeballed.
 *   - --exclude <sel,…> display:none's in-flow third-party widgets AFTER the
 *     settle (layout drops them — a chat launcher in flow was Δ+32 px); run it
 *     on both sides. --exclude-live-only says ASYMMETRIC on the verdict line.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node skills/replica/scripts/stitch-shot.mjs <url> <out.png> [options]
 *     --width <px>        viewport width                    (default 1440)

 *     --settle            slow-scroll lazyload settle pass before capture
 *                         (use on live JS-heavy pages; harmless elsewhere)
 *     --keep-pinned       do NOT hide fixed / stuck-sticky chrome on chunks 2+
 *     --expect-height <px> exit 5 when the settled height is < 40 % of this
 *                         (after one retry with --wait doubled)
 *     --exclude <sel,…>   display:none these after the settle (both sides)
 *     --exclude-live-only marks the --exclude list as applied on this side only
 *     --mask-sel <sel,…>  record the page-space rects of matched elements in the
 *                         sidecar masksRects[] (kind sel); fixed/sticky matches

 *     --mask-iframes      record every iframe box (kind iframe)
 *     --mask-images       record every img box ≥ 40×40 (kind img)
 *     --masks-json <file> the project's inventory-declared masks
 *                         (stardust/replica/masks.json; schema + validator in
 *                         capture-sidecar.mjs): adds its sel entries to
 *                         --mask-sel and switches on the iframes/images flags it
 *                         declares; an invalid file is exit 1 before any capture
 *                         Rects are read at scroll 0 after the settle; nothing
 *                         is painted — masks are applied by the compare side,
 *                         symmetrically, from both sidecars (pixel-compare
 *                         --mask-from / --masks-json)
 *     --allow-overlay     capture even when a fixed / dialog element covers
 *                         > 30 % of the first viewport after dismissal
 *     --consent <sel>     extra consent selector, tried before the built-in
 *                         candidates (the reject list in deny mode);
 *                         "text:<label>" matches a button by its exact label
 *                         (recorded as consent.via "text:<label>")
 *     --consent-mode <m>  accept | deny (default accept; see above)
 *     --allow-consent     capture even when a consent container is still
 *                         visible after the dismissal window (default exit 5)
 *     --no-dismiss-defaults  keep live-session's persistent-widget HIDE list
 *                         off (the click passes always run)
 *     --remove-text <phrase>  hide the nearest fixed/sticky ancestor of any
 *                         element containing <phrase> (repeatable; last
 *                         resort for an undismissable bar — run on BOTH sides)
 *     --dismiss <sel,...> extra overlay-dismiss selectors (marketing modals
 *                         with non-standard close controls)
 *     --block <substr,...> abort every request whose URL contains one of the
 *                         substrings (undismissable iframe/shadow widgets); the
 *                         main-frame navigation and the page's own origin are
 *                         never blocked. Run the SAME value on both sides —
 *                         the sidecar records `blocked` and an asymmetric pair
 *                         is refused by pixel-compare
 *     --headed[=window]    bot-management ladder start: tier 2 (real Chrome headless); =window tier 3 (off-screen window). Default: the tier extract recorded
 *     --storage-state <file> | --fresh-state | --solve-wait <ms>  admitted-session reuse / clean start / interactive solve (live-session.mjs § Admitted-session reuse; --solve-wait implies a visible tier-3 window)
 *     --locale <tag>      pin Accept-Language + locale (e.g. en-GB)
 *     --ua <string>       user agent                        (default real-Chrome)
 *     --wait <ms>         initial post-load wait            (default 1200; 3000 with --settle)
 *     --timeout <ms>      goto timeout                      (default 60000)
 *
 * Example:
 *   node skills/replica/scripts/stitch-shot.mjs https://www.example.com \
 *     stardust/replica/gates/home-1440/live.png --width 1440 --settle
 *
 * Requires: playwright, pngjs (project devDependencies), and the diff skill's
 * scripts dir alongside (live-session.mjs — the replica Setup copies both).
 * Exit codes: 0 written (PNG + sidecar), 1 error (incl. scroll stall /
 * deflection), 3 bot challenge (live side blocked, or a stitched capture
 * that is short AND challenge-phrased / near-empty — fail loud, never
 * captured), 5 invalid capture — no PNG, no sidecar, NO VERDICT, never a
 * FAIL: a consent container still visible after the dismissal window (deny
 * mode: no reject control, or still visible after the reject click; accept
 * mode: nothing matched — --consent <sel>/"text:<label>" or --allow-consent
 * on BOTH sides); settled
 * height < 40 % of --expect-height after one retry; an
 * error-boundary page; an overlay still covering > 30 % of the first
 * viewport after dismissal (--allow-overlay). gate.sh maps 5 like 3.
